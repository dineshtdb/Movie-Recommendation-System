# Movie Recommendation System

*The landscape of cinema has been rapidly evolving, especially with the rise of online streaming platforms. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global video streaming market size was valued at approximately $42.6 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.4% from 2020 to 2027. With the rise of platforms like Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime, movies and TV shows have become more accessible than ever. Despite this abundance, users often find it challenging to discover new content tailored to their preferences. Many streaming services rely on rudimentary algorithms, leading to unsatisfactory recommendations. In this project, I will design an advanced recommendation system for the MovieStream platform, aiming to provide users with precise and personalized movie suggestions.*
## 1. Data


The dataset was sourced from two distinct locations, both on Kaggle. One dataset features movies from IMDB, while the other showcases content from Netflix. These datasets were subsequently merged to create a comprehensive Movie/TV series collection. The posters associated with each movie or TV series were procured from TMDB.
